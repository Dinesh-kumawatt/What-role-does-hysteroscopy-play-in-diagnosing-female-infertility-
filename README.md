Hysteroscopy is a simple yet powerful procedure that allows doctors to see the inside of a woman’s uterus using a thin camera called a hysteroscope. This outpatient procedure is extremely valuable in diagnosing and sometimes treating uterine problems that can cause infertility, repeated miscarriages, or irregular bleeding.

During a hysteroscopy, the doctor inserts the camera through the vagina and cervix directly into the uterus. This helps them clearly visualize the uterine lining and detect abnormalities such as polyps, fibroids, scar tissue, adhesions, or a septum. Many of these conditions, if not treated, can prevent an embryo from implanting or lead to miscarriage.

What makes hysteroscopy so important is that it is both diagnostic and therapeutic. Many times, the doctor can treat the issue right then and there without needing another surgery. It's a low-risk procedure, doesn’t require incisions, and recovery is usually very fast—most women return to daily activities within a day.
